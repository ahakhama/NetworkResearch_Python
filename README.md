# some small project
Here I put some python code about my P609 computational physics class assignment.

stochastic_block_model.py is an implementation of Newman's stochastic block model with some .gml files to test

newmangreedy.py is an implementation of Newman's fast greedy algorithm, which can also be tested by .gml files.

The rest are some homeworks of computational physics.
