# PythonPractise
Here I put some python files for my P609 computational physics class and play with github 

stochastic_block_model.py is an implement of Newman's stochastic block model with some .gml files to test

newmangreedy.py is an implement of Newman's fast greedy algorithm.

The rest are some homeworks
