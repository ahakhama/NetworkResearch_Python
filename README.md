# PythonPractise
Here I put some python files for my P609 computational physics class and play with github 

blockmodel.py is an implement of Newman's stochastic block model with some .gml files to test

newmangreedy.py is an implement of Newman's fast greedy algorithm.

The rest are some homeworks
